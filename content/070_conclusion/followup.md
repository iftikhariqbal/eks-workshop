We want to follow up with you to see how things are going on learning containers security and shift-left.  

Our Cloud Security Architects will host an SE call Post-SKO. The purpose is to re-emphasize some of the key points from the SE Summit Cloud training session and answer follow up questions. 

This one-hour online meeting will focus on:

+ SKO Cloud summit content review
+ McAfee solutions alignment to IaaS/PaaS security requirements
+ Q&A
 
You will shortly receive a Webex invite including all the details.
