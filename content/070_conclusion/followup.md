## Followup Session 

We want to follow up with you to see how things are going on learning 
containers security and shift-left.   

 

Our Cloud Security Architects will host an SE call Post-SKO. The purpose is to re-emphasize some of the key points from the SE Summit Cloud training session and answer follow up questions.  

 

This one-hour online meeting will focus on: 

 

SKO Cloud summit content review 

McAfee solutions alignment to IaaS/PaaS security requirements 

Q&A 

  

You will shortly receive a Webex invite including all the details. 

 

Get prepared with your questions! 

 

Thanks.
