# Introduction to MVISION Cloud

MVISION Cloud is a broad security platform designed to provide a variety of services to customers who need security policy in cloud assets. 

#### Examples 
 - SaaS services such as Office 365, Slack, Salesforce, Workday, etc.
 - Containers running in services like AWS Kubernetes
 - Data Loss Prevention Policies tied to data in cloud services and IaaS
 - Collaboration events such as controlled sharing of sensitive data externally 
 - Threat prevention (Insider threats, impossible travel, anomalous behavior, compromised accounts, malware protection)

#### Goals 
In this lab, we will focus on DevOps/DevSecOps/Developer roles and their need to have a simple approach to securing cloud resources. 

Container Security, Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) and Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) are fundamental shifts for customers. 

For most companies, their cloud transformation includes simple concepts such as a cloud migration strategy for legacy resources (i.e. moving server infrastructure and data to a public cloud). However, cloud transformation also includes building infrastructure for new projects, customer facing applications, and other modern workflows commonly associated with DevOps and DevSecOps.
