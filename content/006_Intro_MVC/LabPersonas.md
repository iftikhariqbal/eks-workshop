# Lab Personas

### Personas for this lab: 
This lab is designed for you to understand how AWS and McAfee work together to help secure your cloud environments as you take on modern Container infrastructure. The lab takes into account that you may or may not have experience as a DevSecOps engineer - helping you see how you can deploy apps and services in the cloud security and in an automated way. 

It is helpful to consider the challenges one of these engineers may have when pushing software or infrastructure to a public cloud in a secure manner. Engineers and developers do not intentially put bad code or configurations into production; but to consider that having a tool like MVISION Cloud could facilitate prevention of these types of violations can be a major time saver as well as may keep the orginization safer overall.
