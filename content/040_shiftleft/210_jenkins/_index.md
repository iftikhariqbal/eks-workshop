# Understand Jenkins

In this Chapter, we will walk you through the shared Jenkins instance that you have access to as part of this lab and explain the modules.
Please login to jenkins using the credentials for this workshop at  https://jenkins.sesummit20.net/jenkins

You have user, not admin, permissions in this instance and can see only your own jobs in the folder named as your codeword.
