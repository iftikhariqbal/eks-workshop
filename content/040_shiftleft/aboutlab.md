## About the labs with Jenkins

We built a scenario where you will be an engineer working on applications running in the cloud (AWS). We provided you with Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) tools like codecommit, cloudformation and Jenkins. In the lab we integrate Jenkins with MVISION CLOUD to scan the cloudformation template for security misconfiguration. If any violation is detected the deployment of the stack will fail. Your goal is to find the misconfiguration in the template and fix it. Once fixed you will be able to deploy AWS recourses like EC2, S3 and EBS.
We provided you with three cloudformation templates:

Lab1:  Easy – Deploy EC2

Lab2:  Medium – Deploy S3

Lab3:  Hard – Deploy EBS volume
