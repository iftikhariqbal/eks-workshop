## What is "Shift-Left"?

Traditional software development models have lumped most changes and improvements into large releases each of which has a planning, coding, testing, and release schedule.  Releases would often be several months or years apart which means that customers would have to wait a long time for features or bug fixes even though the code is already done.

Shift-left mentality changes this model in a few key ways:

1.  Small improvements and bug fixes are added continuously.
2.  Planning, coding, testing, and releases are continous processes that can lead to several releases per day.
3.  The development cycle is driven by automation (AKA the CI/CD pipeline) rather than people processes.
