##  welcome to our Shift-Left and Jenkins Lab

## About the lab with Jenkins

We built a scenario where you will be an engineer working on applications running in the cloud (AWS). We provided you with Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) tools like codecommit, cloudformation and Jenkins. In the lab we integrate Jenkins with MVISION CLOUD to scan the cloudformation template for security misconfiguration. 

1.	To build and test your software projects continuously
2.	To find and solve defects and misconfigurations in the code base rapidly
3.	To make automatically deployed your code build as soon as it complies with CIS1, CIS2 regulatory frameworks and security best-practices.

  What to achieve (high-level)?

1.	Connect your CI/CD tool (Jenkins) to your code repository hosting the CloudFormation templates.
2.	Use the McAfee Mvision Cloud plugin for Jenkins to intercept security misconfigurations during the code build.
3.	Analyze any misconfiguration reported and apply the according change in your code
4.	Validate the change you made in the code and deploy the application in AWS


We provided you with three cloudformation templates:

Lab1:  Easy – Deploy EC2

Lab2:  Medium – Deploy S3

Lab3:  Hard – Deploy RDS (DB)
